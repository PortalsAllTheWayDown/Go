Conditional For Loops
Besides the for variations introduced in the last lectures, there also is another common variation (which will also be shown again later in the course):

for someCondition {
  // do something ...
}
someCondition is an expression that yields a boolean value or a variable that contains a boolean value (i.e., true or false).

In that case, the loop will continue to execute the code inside the loop body until the condition / variable yields false.
